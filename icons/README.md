# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in different sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for extension menu)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (for Windows computers)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should:

1. Be square (same width and height)
2. Have a clear, recognizable design
3. Work well at small sizes
4. Use PNG format with transparency if needed

## Suggested Design

Consider using:
- A combination of movie-related symbols (film reel, star ratings)
- IMDb yellow (#F5C518) and Rotten Tomatoes red (#FA320A) colors
- Simple, bold design that's readable at 16x16 pixels

For now, you can use any square image files and rename them to match the required filenames.
